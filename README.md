# Civility
A base building colony creating game, where the player constructs their empire, dominating the world and beating their rivals.

This game is a hobby project between Brian Hulbert and Tristan Lonsway, worked on and designed during our Junior year in High School. 
The game is still currently in development, with limited gameplay features, but most of the engine and server features are outlined or completed.
We do plan on eventually completing this project, though programming with our chosen environment takes time.
